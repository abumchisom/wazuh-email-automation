## 1. OSSEC.conf

This project outlines how I configured my Wazuh manager/server to automatically send in critical email alerts.

---
> After editing your `ossec.conf`, restart the Wazuh manager using `sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager`

## 2. SMTP Setup
---
> Next is to make your SMTP configuration.

Check the [commands.md](commands.md) for the setup guide.

Once you are done, check your recipient's email.
